I developed a Portuguese card game that tracked the score during each round and gave an overall winner using Python. I implemented various functions and file parsing to simulate the game and its conditions, gave cards their respective values, and implemented the game's rules so that only certain parameters could occur ensuring that no issues could appear with invalid cards, suits, and ranks or scores.
